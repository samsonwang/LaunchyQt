Building on Linux:

For Debian and Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libboost-dev g++ dh-make
qmake -r Launchy.pro ; make ; sudo make install

To build a deb package:
cd linux ; ./build_deb.sh <version> such as ./buid_deb.sh 2.2



Building and installing on Mac OS X:

0) Install the boost C++ library
1) Install the QT SDK
2) qmake Launchy.pro -spec macx-g++ -r CONFIG+=release
3) make ; make install
 -- Launchy is now built and installed in release/Launchy.app
4) cd mac
5) sh mkdmg
6) Now there is a release/Launchy.dmg
5) copy Launchy.app to your Applications folder



Building on Windows:

Requirements: 
1) Visual Studio 2005 w/ SP1
2) QT 4.6 or greater.
3) Boost


Installing QT:
. Download QT SDK at: https://qt.nokia.com/products
. Run the installer

. Setting the QT environment variables:
. Go to control panel -> System -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables
. Add these 2 variables to your user variables
. Variable = QMAKESPEC    Value = win32-msvc2005
. Variable = QTDIR        Value = c:\qt\2009.05

. Open a Visual Studio 2005 command prompt
. cd c:\qt\2009.05\
. configure -opensource -no-webkit 
. nmake

The configure and nmake commands take a very long time.

Download Boost from http://www.boost.org/users/download/
Install Boost libraries to c:\boost

Building Launchy:

. Download launchy from subversion, the url to use is this: https://launchy.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/launchy/trunk/Launchy_QT/
. From the command line, cd to the launchy directory and type '%QTDIR%\qmake\qmake -tp vc -r launchy.pro' to build the Visual Studio .sln files
. Double click on the resulting launchy.sln
. F7 to compile!


Launchy and QT can also be built using Visual Studio 2008, just set use win32-msvc2008 instead of win32-msvc2005. In this scenario, there are binary compatibility issues with plugins built using Visual Studio 2005 which will cause a runtmacdeployqt ../release/Launchy.appime error and refuse to load.

When you run Launchy, note that only one skin is installed in the debug\release directories.  
Launchy looks awfully funny when it can't find its skin!
